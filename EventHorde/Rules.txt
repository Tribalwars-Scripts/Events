General Event Rules:

Attack of the Horde

Welcome to the Attack of the Horde event! Here's a quick primer to get you started.
Step 1: Take arms
Unknown forces have besieged many of our villages. Call your secret troops and attack the siege armies.

Step 2: Call your troops and find the weak spot in their defense

Offense is the best defense. Attack the weak spots of the horde with your secret troops, but only one unit type is suitable to defeat the attackers.

Send scouts to get a better overview about the weakness of the army. Each scout action costs 10 tokens


Step 3: Defeat the enemy

Once you found every weakness in their army you can defeat them completely. You will receive 150 Guidons for each successful spot defeated, and additional Guidons if you defeat all the spots, depending on the amount of attempts you need (max. 500 Guidons).


Step 4: Find the answer

To liberate your village you need "attack plans", which will be generated by your generals on an hourly basis.
    Starting an attack will require one "attack plan"
    Finding a new battle opportunity will require two "attack plans"


Other Rules:
You start with 10 "attack plans".
You can purchase attack plans, the prices are as follows:
1 Attack Plan -> 10tokens
5 Attack Plans -> 45tokens
10 Attack Plans -> 80tokens

To perform a attack, you need to fill 5 slots with 1 out of 7 potential units:
halberd, morningstar, bigaxe, crossbow, knives, hammer, scimitar

It's also known that at least 2 of the 5 slots will contain the same unit.

In each attack plan perform, you'll get a response with one of the following color code and their respective meaning:
Green -> Unit Slot successful
Yellow -> Correct Unit, wrong slot
Red -> Wrong Unit
